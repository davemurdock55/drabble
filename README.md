An app to help writers practice writing and improve their craft, having fun along the way! Drabble is an app created by writers for writers to help them get in a better habit of writing each day and honing their skills.

### Plans:
- A React.js `frontend` created with `create-react-app` integrating typescript
- A node.js `backend` using express and integrating typescript for type safety
- Shared object models between the frontend and backend for consistency
